WIP: Not done yet, works fine but does not import existing subdomains (however, does add new ones fine)

Adds nginx reverse proxy on SSL add in interworx (port 8443) and installs a wildcard reverse proxy on port 8080 (all IPs).

The backend domain is resolved against the local interworx DNS so it ends up on the correct IP regardless of nginx listening on all IPs.
This tool requires a basic nginx configuration which can be done on any centos 6/7 based system with the -install action (self compiles nginx, read script for more info, can just copy step by step)

>> No root is required if appropriate sudo permissions are set to reload nginx and a custom script to chown nginx config files to iworx user (as nginx sets root:root on restart).


You need to add 3 hook lines in the interworx hooks file as follows:

#hook for new add
Ctrl_Siteworx_Ssl install /scripts/add_nginx.sh new
#hook for SSL removal to remove Nginx config
Ctrl_Siteworx_Ssl uninstall /scripts/add_nginx.sh del
#hook for Siteworkx account deletion as this does not trigger SSL uninstall
Ctrl_Nodeworx_Siteworx delete /scripts/add_nginx.sh del


Existing domains can be imported with the "-import" action, after that the port 443 iptables can be enabled to move traffic to Nginx.
